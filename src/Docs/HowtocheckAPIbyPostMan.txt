Let's do the following steps:

Step 1: Open file NewAPI of controllers/admin/API and comment rows have this code:"newModel.setCreatedBy"
Step 2: Insert below that code is this code "newModel.setCreatedBy("admin")" into that file.
Step 3: Set data that will be transferred to the server to JSON type in Postman.
Step 4: Copy and paste this code into the body of the data JSON in Postman:
{
    "title":"Bài viết 5",
    "thumbnail":"",
    "shortDescription":"Bài viết 5",
    "content":"Bài viết 5",
    "categoryCode":"the-thao",
    "createdBy":"admin"
}

Step 5: Open file web.xml of the directory is WEB-INF of webapp directory.
Comment the following code:
<!--    <filter>-->
<!--        <filter-name>servletFilter</filter-name>-->
<!--        <filter-class>com.sourcedemo.filter.AuthorizationFilter</filter-class>-->
<!--    </filter>-->
<!--    <filter-mapping>-->
<!--        <filter-name>servletFilter</filter-name>-->
<!--        <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>-->
<!--    </filter-mapping>-->

If you received JSON data which returned from server, we already have success.
